# ✅ Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

1. Use a **minimum of 12 characters** — longer is better.
2. Include a mix of:
   - Uppercase letters (A–Z)
   - Lowercase letters (a–z)
   - Numbers (0–9)
   - Special characters (! @ # $ % ^ & *)
3. Avoid dictionary words or common patterns like `123`, `qwerty`, `password`.
4. Do **not reuse** passwords across different sites or accounts.
5. Use **passphrases** — combinations of random words, optionally with punctuation (e.g., `Ocean!Laptop_Grass47`).
6. Store passwords in a trusted **password manager** (like Bitwarden, 1Password, or KeePass).
7. Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** where possible.
