# ❌ Removed Extensions & Why

## 1. CookieManager
- Redundant with Cookie-Editor.
- Better to stick to one for simplicity.

## 2. Email Exporter
- Can collect personal information from webpages.
- Not necessary unless scraping is essential—and even then, risky.

## 3. Maps Scraper & Leads Extractor
- Violates Google/Bing Maps TOS.
- Collects sensitive business data.
- High risk of being flagged as malicious.
